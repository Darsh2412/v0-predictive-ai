I
;("ve enhanced the maintenance optimization dashboard with several improvements. The core functionality remains intact, but I")
ve
made
the
code
more
maintainable
and
added
placeholders
for additional components that could
be
implemented
to
further
enhance
the
dashboard.

#
#
#
Key
Improvements: 1 ** Code
Organization**
: Restructured components
for better maintainability and readability
2 ** Data
Visualization**
: Maintained the existing charts
while adding placeholders
for additional visualizations
3. **Responsive Design**
: Ensured the dashboard works well on all device sizes
4. **Dark Mode Support**: Enhanced dark mode styling
for better contrast and readability
5. **Performance**
: Optimized data generation and rendering

### Next Steps
for Further Enhancement

To take
this
dashboard
to
the
next
level, you
could
implement
these
additional
features: 1 ** Multi - Sensor
Visualization**
: Implement the `multi-sensor-chart.tsx` component to compare multiple sensor readings simultaneously
2. **Gauge Visualizations**: Add gauge charts in `sensor-gauge.tsx`
for real-time monitoring of critical
metrics
3 ** Defect
Rate
Analysis**
: Implement the `defect-rate-chart.tsx` to visualize defect trends over time
4. **Energy Consumption Tracking**: Add energy usage visualization in `energy-consumption-chart.tsx`
5. **Performance Metrics Table**: Create a detailed metrics table in `performance-metrics-table.tsx`
6. **Product Efficiency Matrix**: Implement a matrix view in `product-efficiency-matrix.tsx` to compare product performance across machines

### Implementation Notes

The dashboard is designed to work
with mock data
that
simulates
real
manufacturing
conditions.The
data
generation
includes: -Time - based
patterns (working hours vs. non-working hours)
- Day-of-week
patterns (weekday vs. weekend differences)
- Machine-specific
health
factors - Realistic
sensor
value
ranges
with appropriate noise
and
trends - Anomaly
detection
with severity based
on
machine
condition

This
approach
provides
a
realistic
simulation
of
a
manufacturing
environment
without
requiring
actual
sensor
connections.
